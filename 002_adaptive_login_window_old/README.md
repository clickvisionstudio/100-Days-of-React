This adaptive login window is an example of how to build a login interface that can adjust to different types of users. This exercise demonstrates the implementation of React concepts like hooks, lifting state up, and two-way binding, thus the implementation is limited to only using `React.useState` hook. Additionally, the exercise utilizes the `styled-components` package to scope component stylings, making styling modularized and reusable.

### How to run the file:
Open the terminal and navigate to this folder, then excuting the following commands to install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```
Then use
```bash
npm run dev
```
to activate the local server, paste the link showing in termial that starts with ``http://localhost:****/`` (where `****` is a 4-digit port number that varies between machines) to the browser.

### Provisional Use Case:
- Website/App user login
